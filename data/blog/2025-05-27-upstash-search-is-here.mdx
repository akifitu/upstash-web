Today, we're launching the Upstash Search Preview. **A simple, lightweight, and scalable way to add AI-powered search to your app**.

Most search products today are slow to set up, hard to scale, and surprisingly expensive. We wanted something simpler.

We're building Upstash Search to be:

- Simple and developer-friendly
- Fast and accurate
- Ready to scale to any data size with no extra setup

---

## Why We're Building Search

We talked to a lot of developers using search in real apps. Three problems came up over and over:

### 1. Search Doesn't Understand Meaning

❌ Most search products match exact keywords. When your users search "how do I cancel my subscription", they get zero results because your docs say "unsubscribe" or "manage billing". I've seen this happen in real apps and it's really frustrating as a user 💀

✅ Upstash Search understands what users mean, not just what they type. It knows "cancel subscription", "unsubscribe", and "stop billing" all mean the same thing. We achieve this by combining traditional full-text search with AI-powered semantic search.

### 2. Too Complicated

❌ Other products (we'll avoid names here) feel like they were built for large enterprises first. You need to learn a whole system and a lot of platform-specific features, even if you only need basic search.

✅ With Upstash Search, you can start in minutes. There's no infrastructure to manage and no complicated docs you need to read before you see results.

### 3. Too Expensive

❌ Some products look affordable at first, but the cost adds up fast. This can be because of intransparent licensing rules, hidden usage fees, or scaling costs that spike without warning. Even small apps can end up with big bills once they grow.

✅ We want our billing to be as simple as possible. You only pay for what you use, even at scale.

## What Makes Upstash Search Different

Before starting work on search, we've laid out the most important points we want to optimize for. As we're letting users into our preview version, we're constantly iterating on these:

- **👉 Getting started is plug-and-play**

        You can get started in minutes. No cluster setup and no complicated dashboards. Create a database, insert documents, and you're ready to search.

- **👉 Hybrid semantic & full-text search**

        To deliver the best possible results, we combine full-text and semantic search. That way, even vague queries capture user search intent and return great results.

- **👉 Scales with your data**

        We've scaled Upstash Redis to handle billions of requests per day. We're using that same experience to build Search. It can handle anything from a small blog to massive data sizes.

- **👉 Perfect for modern stacks**

        Upstash Search works with any modern web framework using a TypeScript-first SDK. You can also use the REST API directly.

## How It Works

Under the hood, Upstash Search uses a mix of:

- **Full-text search** to find exact keyword matches
- **Semantic search** to find matches based on meaning and intent
- **Smart ranking** to order the best results first

Search also supports advanced filters, so you can limit results by city, tag, type, or anything else your app needs.

## Example Use Cases

Here's where Upstash Search really shines:

- **👉 Content search for blogs, docs, and wikis**

        Automatically handle typos, questions, or vague queries. Readers get the right article without needing perfect phrasing.

- **👉 E-commerce product search**

        Match on meaning, not just keywords. A search for "jogging shoes" can return "running sneakers" without any extra setup.

- **👉 Dashboards and internal tools**

        Let teams search across logs, tickets, assets, or notes. All with built-in filters, metadata, and smart relevance.
