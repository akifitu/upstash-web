We're introducing new pricing plans to better meet the needs of our diverse user base.

### **Key Changes:**

1. **Larger Free Tier**:
    - The free tier will now include **500K requests per month**, an increase from the previous 10K daily limit.
2. **Pay-as-You-Go (PAYG) Updates**:
    - We are removing the bandwidth limit. First 200GB bandwidth is free, beyond that $0.03 per GB as before.
    - Max storage limit is increased to 100GB from 10GB.
3. **Pro Plans Removed**:
    - Pro plans are being phased out. Instead, we're introducing a **Prod Pack** add-on for production features like SOC-2 compliance, Uptime SLA, and advanced monitoring.
    - This will be available for all plans at **$200/month per DB**.
4. **New Fixed Plans**:
    - These plans offer fixed storage and bandwidth at a set price. The smallest plan starts at **$10/month** for 256MB of storage.
    - There will be auto-upgrade option if you prefer scale up.

### **Transition Details:**

- These changes will apply to **new databases** and **existing free/PAYG databases** starting **March 1, 2025**.
- Pro customers will be contacted later for transition options.

### **Why These Changes?**

We’ve listened to your feedback:

- Some users prefer to remain on a pay-as-you-go plan, even when they require higher bandwidth and storage.
- Some users prefer **fixed plans** over PAYG, especially in non-serverless environments.
- There’s growing demand for **production features** like SOC-2 and SLA, but many don’t want to upgrade to Pro plans.
- Users with **high bandwidth** needs often face unexpectedly high costs when throughput increases.

Our goal is to balance these needs and create plans that scale from startups to enterprises, work for both serverless and traditional environments, and are easy to understand. Please take a look at our [new pricing here](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/pricing).

We don't expect a significant cost increase for most users. Your feedback continues to guide these improvements, and we appreciate your input.
