## What is changing?

We're increasing the limits for Upstash Redis.

| Limit | New value | Old value |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Max throughput (tps) | 10k  | 1k |
| Max request size | 10MB | 1MB |
| Max concurrent connections | 10k | 1k |


All the plans that have lower limits than the new ones are affected (including free and pay-as-you-go plans).


## Why are we increasing the limits?

We see many users experiencing friction when using Upstash Redis due to these limits. A serverless database should scale with minimal issues.

## Why did/do we have limits?

Although the ultimate goal is to scale infinitely, we need some resource planning assumptions to provide a good experience for all users. Also, we use these limits to encourage users to find the right plan for their use cases without big overcharges.


## Should you do anything?

No, you don't need to do anything. We will apply the new limits to your Redis DB automatically without downtime.


## What if you need more?
If you need more, you can always [contact us](https://upstash.com/contact) for a custom plan.
