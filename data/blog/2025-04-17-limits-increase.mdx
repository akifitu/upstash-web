## What Is Changing?

Thanks to recent infrastructure improvements, we're increasing three core Upstash Redis limits by **10x** — while maintaining the same high standards of performance and reliability. These increases are rolling out across all plans, including Free and Pay-as-You-Go.

This is the [second time in two months](https://upstash.com/blog/redis-new-pricing) we've raised our Redis limits.

---

## New vs. Old Limits

| Limit | Old  | New  |
|-------|------|------|
| Max throughput (TPS)       | 1k   | 10k  |
| Max request size           | 1MB  | 10MB |
| Max concurrent connections | 1k   | 10k  |

All plans that previously had lower limits — including Free, Pay-as-You-Go, and Fixed Plans — will now have the new higher limits.

---

## Why the Increase?

Month over month, Upstash Redis is powering more production workloads than ever: high concurrency, large payloads, and large-scale user traffic. The old limits occasionally became bottlenecks.

We want Upstash to be the go-to platform for building serious, high-quality software — whether you're shipping a weekend side project or scaling to millions of users.

These new limits reflect the platform we're building: high performance, zero infrastructure to manage, and the ability to grow with you.

## No Action Required

The new limits apply automatically to all existing and future databases. No config changes required. No downtime.

---

## Need Even More?

By increasing throughput, request size, and connection limits, we're making it easy to start small and scale as you grow — without paying for what you don't use. These new changes are designed to support all use cases, from small startups to large enterprises.

If you need even higher limits, [get in touch](https://upstash.com/contact) and we'll set you up with a custom plan.
